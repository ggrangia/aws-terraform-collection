I could have used a module for the two "support" accounts,
but I skipped it for simplicity.

Here I have everything defined in the same statefile, so I can access the resolver rules in the "support" accounts. In a real scenario, it is likely that they do not live in the same statefile, hence a data lookup is be necessary.
